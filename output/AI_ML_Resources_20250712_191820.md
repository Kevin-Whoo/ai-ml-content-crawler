**📅 Date:** 2025-07-07 | **🎯 Score:** 1.5

**📝 Summary:** Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\...

### 25. [Preemptive Solving of Future Problems: Multitask Preplay in Humans and Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05561v1)
**📅 Date:** 2025-07-08 | **🎯 Score:** 1.0

**📝 Summary:** Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Pr...
